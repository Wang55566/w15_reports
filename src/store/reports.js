/*
Export both the following action constants and their corresponding actions:

1. `RECEIVE_REPORTS` (corresponding action should have a `reports` payload)
2. `RECEIVE_REPORT` (corresponding action should have a `report` payload)
3. `REMOVE_REPORT` (corresponding action should have a `reportId` payload)

*/

/* 
Export a `getAllReports` selector that returns an array of all the reports in
the store. Also export a `getReport` selector that takes in a reportId and
returns the given report from the store.
*/

/*
Export a `reportsReducer` function as the default export. It should take in the
old state and appropriately handle all report actions.
